# seasons
This is an in-progress side project I am working on based on my love for winter, a season I truly miss here in Central Texas!\
\
However, once it's fully deployed, it won't be just for those who yearn for the cold--but also for those looking to escape it.\
\
Using the [Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org/) API, current temperatures are generated for the user's city and a number of other cities to show the temperature difference from the user's location. Users can also visit [Expedia](https://www.expedia.com/) to view hotel/flight packages for specific dates.\

Check it out in its current form at: https://jenntuten.github.io/seasons/.
